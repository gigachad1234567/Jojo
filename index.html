      Are Vampires Real



	Do you think vampires are real? Well it is a myth that people have never busted. So today I will be explaining if vampires are real or if they are not.


	First, Vampires are not real but some people say they are. Some say that in specific countries vampires do exist. Second, According to google vampires could have a possibility of being real but it is not proven because no one has ever ever seen one.

	
	First, Vampires could exist. Itâ€™s because a long time ago people were creating how to kill vampires with a wooden stake. This is a reason why vampires exist because why would they create that. Second, scientists have found bodies with wooden stakes in their hearts.


	Vampires could or could not be real. But in my opinion I think they are not real because scientists have not found evidence that really proves that they are real. So in my opinion I think vampires are just a myth.
